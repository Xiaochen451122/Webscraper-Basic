# Webscraper-Basic

Use Node.js as the main language to create a basic Web Scraper function. Here are some libraries which should be installed first;

Use 'express' to start a localhost 3000 http server (npm install express).

Use 'superagent' to request the target webpage (npm install superagent).

Use 'cheerio' to catch the page elements and data (npm install cheerio).

Use 'nightmare' to avoid the impact due to the different loading time (npm sintall nightmare).

I use the Baidu News (http://news.baidu.com/) as an example, catch the information in the DOM structure ('div#pane-news ul li a'). 

In the next following stage, I will add time, which can search the information every 30 seconds (example).
